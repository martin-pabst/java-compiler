# TODO-List

## done:
  * wire up interpreter  -> done!
  * CodeGenerator: while-loop, then test performance... -> done. Looks great!
  * CodeGenerator: implicit casting -> done, needs testing...
  * CodeGenerator: class declaration -> done
  * CodeGenerator: method-declaration -> done (without ellipsis yet...)
  * CodeGenerator: method-call -> done
  * CodeGenerator: object instantiation -> done
  * CodeGenerator: field access -> done
  * CodeGenerator: constant folding -> done
  * try ... catch ... finally -> done
  * check if return statement happened in every execution line
  * check if local variables have been initialized before first access
  * wire up step over, step into, step out
  * enums...    -> needs more testing
  * interfaces...  -> needs more testing
  * use templates to generate fast code for static library functions like Math.sin, Math.atan2, ...
  * invoke methods on expressions wich evaluate to a string primitive (with constant folding)


## next todos
  * generics
  * library method to gather information for automated tests
  * library method examples
  * Lambda Functions
  * Array constants
